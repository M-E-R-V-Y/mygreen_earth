            <H1>THE DEFINITION OF WASTE</H1><br>
            <P>Here is the definition of waste given by law: "Waste is any residue from a production, transformation or use process,<br> any substance, material, product ... that its holder intends to abandon".</P><br>
        
                <p>Waste is therefore anything that is no longer useful to us and that we decide to throw away.</p><br>
                
                <p>We constantly produce a multitude of waste!</p><br>
                
                <p>To treat them better, the waste is classified by category according to its nature, its origin or its more or less toxic character.</p><br>
                
                <p>Let's see how they are classified!</P>
